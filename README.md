# Statistical Learning from Scratch

A collection of machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch using Python and NumPy, based on "Introduction to Statistical Learning".

## Project Overview

This project implements various statistical learning methods from first principles using only Python and NumPy. Each algorithm is tested in Jupyter notebooks using datasets from scikit-learn.

## Algorithms Implemented

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Linear/Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
- More to Come!

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- Jupyter
- scikit-learn

## Datasets

The implementations are tested using scikit-learn datasets:
- Iris
- Breast Cancer Wisconsin
